# 🏠 Carbon House Code Test

**by Nolan Patterson**

Welcome! This repo contains my code test submission for Carbon House. I had a great time building this and used the opportunity to revisit some foundational front-end tooling while also applying modern practices.

## 📝 Notes

This project uses **Gulp** and several supporting Node modules. While I’m new to Gulp, I’ve included everything needed to prevent breaking changes.

At my current role, we typically use **CodeKit** on macOS for compiling `.kit` files, but I deliberately avoided it here assuming your workflow may differ. This setup reflects a more universal, build-friendly approach.

## 💭 Reflection

This project brought back a lot of nostalgic energy — it reminded me of when I first started web development.

Deciding on a tech stack, optimizing build tools, and planning structure made this feel like a full-circle moment. It was a great way to benchmark how far I’ve come over the past 5 years, and I really enjoyed working on it!
